NOTES ON AUTOCONVERTING

Runtime (WDL)
docker [] -> DockerRequirement, only one image
resources -> ResourceRequirement, megabytes -> mebibytes string

If the output {...} section is omitted, then the workflow includes
all outputs from all calls in its final output.


secondaryFiles
- .fai
- ^.dict

resource and docker requirements: megabytes vs mebibytes

read_X() functions:
if an input parameter is read from a file by a function like read_tsv or read_csv, it must start with a backslash.
wdl2cwl has to transform file inputs in plain strings to a CWL File object.
wdl2cwl only recognizes a filepath in a .txt file if it starts with a backslash. Moreover, all strings starting with '/'
will be treated as filepathes.
